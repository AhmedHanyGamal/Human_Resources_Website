# Human_Resources_Website
a simple website for a company, where employees can apply for vacations, admins can accept or decline the vacation requests, new employees can be added, etc. Made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Django.
NOTE: the project is still in construction. So, I apologise for this.
